- **Hand Gesture Detection**: Use hand gestures to navigate the game board and place your move.
- **Single Player Mode**: Play against the computer.
- **Responsive UI**: The game board and grid adjust based on hand gestures.
- **Computer Opponent**: The computer will automatically make its move after the player's turn.
- **Restart Option**: Play the game multiple times without restarting the application.
